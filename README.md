# Dotfiles :hammer::wrench:
This is my dotfiles setup installation. It's totally based on my needs and preferences but feel comfortable to use or fork if you want to.

*I'm currently working on it and it will probably change always that I figure some config to be done or some software to be installed.*

## Usage
To use it, open your terminal and run:

```bash
# If you have curl installed
curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/dhyegofernando/dotfiles/master/install | bash

# If you have wget installed
wget -q -O - https://raw.github.com/dhyegofernando/dotfiles/master/install | bash
```
